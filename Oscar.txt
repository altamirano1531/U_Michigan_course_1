Arturo, Gloria, Alberto and Alvaro:
           I hope all of you are staying safe as things have just worsened in our respective communities.  I wanted to give you an update on the case.    
           Last Friday, June 26th, Cruz and IBC, though their lawyers filed their Motion to Compel Arbitration and surprisingly, their own Motion to Sever.  See attached.  Their basic argument is that if and when the court rules on Ana’s liability to you all, then they will know whether her case would be ripe to go to Arbitration.  Ana’s pleadings against Cruz and IBC are very basic and one could even argue that she hasn’t plead a proper cause of action against Cruz and IBC.  She basically aregues that you all (Plaintiffs) cannot complain about her conduct because you all approved her actions.  This is not a claim or cause of action, it’s more of an affirmative defense.  Ana appears to just be arguing the affirmative defenses of estoppel, waiver, and/or ratification against you all the Plaintiffs.  I don’t see where her claims against Cruz or IBC are made with any detail at all.  At any rate, I feel now that Cruz and IBC have filed their Motion to Sever, that we will join in and file our own Motion to Sever now that we know that Cruz/IBC’s attorneys are on the same page.   This may make it more acceptable to the Judge in severing the case even though the factual basis of both claims are the same.
           I’ll work on our own Motion for Severance and will get that on file ASAP.  Please note that the courts are still closed for in-person hearings and trials.  With the increase in COVID-19 cases we have not heard when the court system will resume.  Frankly, I don’t see anything of any significance happening before September.   We’ll just have to wait and see how this pandemic progresses.  
           I’ll be in touch soon.  
Be well,
